abstract: "Introduction: 
Researchers have identified a variety of motivations for solitude and for social withdrawal. These motivations may differ across cultures. The purpose of this study was to explore Ugandan adolescents' descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal, with the aim of guiding future research on social withdrawal in Uganda. 

Methods: 
Ugandan adolescents' (M = 14.23 years old, SD = 1.63 years) descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal were investigated in a cross-sectional, exploratory study. The sample (N = 219 [106 girls, 90 boys, 23 missing sex data]) was drawn from two primary schools and a secondary school in Eastern Uganda. Adolescents' responses to open-ended questionnaire items about general solitude, conflicted motivations for social withdrawal, and non-conflicted motivation for social withdrawal were coded and categorized. 

Results: 
Some of the adolescents' descriptions were consistent with the literature. For example, they described shyness and internalizing emotions, externalizing and socially incompetent behaviors, and poor peer relationships. Some descriptions were unique and likely reflected Uganda's challenges, for instance, family or household factors such as being an orphan. 

Conclusions: 
Results underscored the importance of exploring contextual processes (e.g., parental loss) that might affect Ugandan adolescents' solitude. More generally, the results suggested that solitude should be researched using a broad, synergistic lens that incorporates potential determinants from adolescents and their environments at multiple levels (e.g., person, peer, household, culture)."
